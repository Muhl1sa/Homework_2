A new Flutter project created with FlutLab - https://flutlab.io

The project encompasses three main components: GreetingWidget, CounterWidget, and the central orchestrator, MyApp. Each widget plays a distinct role in crafting a simple yet illustrative user interface.The GreetingWidget is a StatelessWidget responsible for presenting a greeting message. It offers customization options, allowing users to tailor the font size, style, and color according to their preferences.In contrast, the CounterWidget is a StatefulWidget designed to manage a mutable state, specifically a counter value. This widget not only displays the current count but also provides a button to increment it. This introduces users to the concept of state management in Flutter.MyApp serves as the central hub, weaving together the GreetingWidget, CounterWidget, and additional greeting instances. The combination of these elements creates a cohesive and visually engaging user interface.
